# One Big Thing â€” React Primitive Edition

This is an homage to [One Big Thing](http://www.onebigthing.co). It's a great app that gives you [productivity super powers](https://medium.com/time-dorks/one-big-thing-a-simple-way-to-do-more-by-planning-less-5ce1428fd4fe): go download it and use it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It uses [glamorous-primitives](https://github.com/nitin42/glamorous-primitives) to provide wonderful rendering flexibility.
